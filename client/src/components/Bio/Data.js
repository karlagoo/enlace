For the past decade I have spent my time mastering deli business management, food merchandising, menu development, and other standard business practices such as inventory management, P&L management, etc. While I loved the industry, it was time for me to make a change into something I was more passionate about. After establishing a family I felt it was time to pursue my dream as a programmer and take steps towards a new tomorrow. Now I am working towards mastering my new skillset: full stack web development.',
